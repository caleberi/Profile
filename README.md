# About Me

I'm all about building scalable and robust applications, bringing over 5+ years of experience. As a Backend Software Engineer, I've driven efficiency improvements of up to 60%, thanks to my expertise in Go and JavaScript.

In my current role at Cudium, as a Senior Software Engineer, I've integrated backend systems with third-party applications, boosting our understanding of user engagement by 85%. Beyond coding, I enjoy mentoring, documentation, and spearheading security features for a safer application.

During my internship at Nomba, I honed Node JS, MongoDB, and Java skills, improving data persistence for vendor services and reducing fraudulent transactions by over 60%.

At Kudi.ai, I implemented transactional features, optimized legacy code, and crafted an account balance slack notification service, boosting stakeholder efficiency by 75%.

At Airgateway, I was focused on enhancing support for agencies in their airline bookings.

You'll find me strumming a guitar, hitting the dance floor, or belting out a tune when not in the tech world. Let's chat over coffee about tech, career journeys, or the latest music trends!

I'm always looking to expand my network. Feel free to reach out at caleberioluwa@gmail.com or connect on Twitter
